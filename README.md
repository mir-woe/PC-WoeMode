# PC-WoeMode
<b> notice </b>
- Built for specifically Powercord. May not work properly on BetterDiscord
- Maintenance cannot be promised
- Will not be posted in #theme-links in either Powercord or BetterDiscord server because I don't see the point as this was just for fun and there's no telling when I will just *drop* this ugly thing
- If you are using my other themes that aren't apart of this respository and are facing issues DM me directly

<b> features </b>
- Dark mode = Pink/Purple accents
- Light mode = Red accents
- - same background for both
