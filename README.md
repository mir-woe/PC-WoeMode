# PC-WoeMode
<b> notice </b>
- Built for specifically Powercord, but has Powercord and BetterDiscord support
- Maintenance cannot be promised
- Will not be posted in #theme-links in either Powercord or BetterDiscord server (may change in due future)

<b> features </b>
- Dark mode = Pink/Purple accents
- Light mode = Red accents
- - same background for both

# install 
<b> Powercord </b>
```
cd AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes && git clone https://github.com/mir-woe/PC-WoeMode/ && del README.md
```
<b> BetterDiscord </b>
- I haven't the slightest clue how BetterDiscord works as a Powercord user, but BetterDiscord doesn't recognise the .css file (and I have no clue why until I spend time to look into it) so this is a work around for now
1) Open BetterDiscord's `settings` -> `Custom CSS`
2) Paste contents of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mir-woe/PC-WoeMode/main/woe/theme.css"> this raw file </a>
